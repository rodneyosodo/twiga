# Building a Scalable Real-time Notification System

Imagine a social media platform where users can follow each other and receive real-time notifications about new posts, comments, and messages.

## Requirements

1. Microservices Architecture:
   - Design the system as a collection of independent microservices that communicate via APIs.
     - User Service: Manages user accounts and profiles.
     - Post Service: Handles creation, storage, and retrieval of posts.
     - Notification Service: Generates and delivers real-time notifications to users.
   - Utilize message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between services.
2. Real-time Notifications:
   - Implement a mechanism for pushing notifications to users in real-time. Consider web sockets, server-sent events (SSE), or message queues for this purpose.
   - Ensure efficient delivery and minimize server load when pushing notifications to a large number of users.
3. Scalability:
   - Design the system to handle a growing number of users and concurrent requests. Consider using technologies like containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for easier deployment and scaling.
   - Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce database load.
4. Persistence:
   - Choose a suitable database (e.g., relational or NoSQL) for storing user information, posts, and notification history.
   - Consider data partitioning and sharding strategies for horizontal scaling of the database.
5. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Integrate monitoring tools to track system health, performance metrics, and identify potential bottlenecks.

## Extra points

- Implement user preferences for notification types and delivery channels (email, push notifications).
- Integrate with a user presence system to optimize notification delivery (only send notifications to active users).
- Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access and malicious activity.

## Deliverables

- Detailed system design document outlining the chosen microservices architecture, communication protocols, and data storage strategies.
- Code demonstrating core functionalities (proof of concept) in your chosen language (Go or Python).

## This challenge allows the developer to showcase their skills in

- Microservice design principles
- Building APIs and inter-service communication
- Real-time communication technologies
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Database management
- Monitoring and observability
